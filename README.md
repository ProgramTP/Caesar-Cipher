# Caesar-Cipher

This is a simple caesar cipher program that encrypts text based on a password given. For example, for the string "Testing" with password "ABC", the encrypted string will add the "T" from "Testing" and the "A" from "ABC", and this continues for each character in the string to encrypt. The password will keep looping.
